Read about couchdb partitioned database:

- https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-database-partitioning
- very interesting
- but created a standard one as (on couchdb, for sync later)
  - we are low-data anyway
  - I'm not sur we can use it as a normal one
- still... will use "user:timestamp" (not even sure it's necessary) just in case, so it is possible to try and migrate
